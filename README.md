# React Tactics Game
This is a work-in-progress attempt to make a tactics game engine with React (similar to Shining Force / Fire Emblem). This project is intended to give me experience with responsive web design, as well as test-driven development using Jest.

### Tech Stack: React.js, Node.js, Jest

## Responsive Web Design

Currently, you can play React Tactics on mobile devices - the game UI will resize for mobile devices in portrait mode (see below), but landscape mode is still a work in progress.

## Setup

To run this app locally, download the source code from this repo and open the command line in the project folder. Run `npm install` to install all package dependencies used for the game, and after that you can use the command `npm start` to run the application on localhost:3000.
