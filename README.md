# React.js Tactics Game
I made this project to gain experience with responsive web design and test-driven development. I chose to make a tactics game specifically because React's official tutorial (making a tic-tac-toe web app) provided a good baseline for board games, and I was already familiar with the format.

### Overview
After choosing a level from the selection screen, players start a game against an AI opponent. The game is turn-based, and at the end of each turn the game checks if level objectives are met/failed, at which point the game is finished.

After a game is completed, players are given a breakdown of how they did and are prompted to return to the level select screen.

### Run Instructions
**Requires Node.js/npm to run the web app locally.**  
Clone this repository, and navigate to the cloned repo folder. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies, and `npm run start` to start the web app.  
Alternatively, open the game in your browser at https://react-tactics.surge.sh/.
